File1 = open('./text.txt', 'r')

path = File1.name
mode = File1.mode

* Always close the file using the File1.close() statement
Using a with statement is better, because it automatically closes the file.


with open('./text.txt', 'r') as File:
	file_stuff=File1.read()
	print file_stuff

print file_stuff

** with open('./text.txt', 'r') as File1:
	file_stuff = File1.readlines()
	print(file_stuff)

>> list of lines as elements, which can be read using a loop

** with open('./text.txt', 'r'):
	file_stuff = File1.readline()
	print(file_stuff)
>> as called once it will print the first line of the file
	file_stuff = File1.readline()
	print(file_stuff)
>> as called secondly, now the second line will be stored in the variable file_stuff

** Looping through a file

with open('./text.txt', 'r') as File1:
	for line in File1:
		print(line)

** Writing text into the file:
Mode w will create a new file
with open('./text.txt', 'w') as File1:
	File1.write('This is line A\n')
	File1.write('This is line B\n')

** Mode a for append will append the line in the same file
with open('text.txt', 'a') as File1:
	File1.write('This is line c')
