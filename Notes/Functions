Built in functions:
1. len():
	input: sequence
	return value: length of the sequence
2. sum():
	input: sequence
	return value: sum of the values in the sequence
3. sorted():
	input: sequence
	return value: sorted sequence

** Python does not allow functions with empty body,
	hence we need to ude the keyword pass when the function is defined
	
	def NoWork():
		pass

	print(NoWork())

** Collecting arguments:
	def ArtistNames(*names):
		for name in names:
			print(name)

	* Called with variable number of arguments hence called variadic parameters.
