Strings can be seen as an ordered sequence of an array of numbers.
** We can also use negative index in python;
	the last character is at negative index. **

	Let Name = 'Michael Jackson'

** Slicing:
	Name[0:4] = 'Mich'
	Name[8:12] = 'Jack'

** Stride
	Name[::2] = 'McalJcsn'

** Slicing and Stride:
	Name[0:5:2] = 'Mca'
